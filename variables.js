//ways to declare variables
var a = 7; //var is a keyword
console.log(a); //It works as same as let
//variable to never change the value
const f = 7; //can't change the value
f = 6; //throws error
//assign value as many as you want but declare them only once
let z;

//identifier rule
//1.start with a letter or _
//2.don't start with a number
//3.don't use keyword like let,var ,console etc.
